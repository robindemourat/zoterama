  <h1>How to connect to Zotero</h1>

  <p>You must have a zotero account to use zoterama. If you have none, please check <a href="https://www.zotero.org/" target="_blank">Zotero website</a>, create a new account, and begin to record some bibliographical references before using Zoterama.</p>
  <p>Given you have a zotero account, here are the steps for setting up an API/zoterama access to your bibliography :</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to <a href="https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys/new" target="_blank">this address</a>, which will allow you to set up an API key for accessing to your bibliography from foreign apps, such as zoterama.</li>
    <li>Give a name to your API key, and be sure that the option "Allow library access"  is the only one checked, and not other options ("Allow Notes access", "Allow write access"), for safety reasons.</li>
    <li>At the end of the page, click on "save key"</li>
    <li>You should be redirected to a zotero page that features all of the keys used to access your library. The one you just created is in the bottom of the list. Just right to your API key name is a series of numbers and letters : select it and copy it - it's your API key ! You'll paste it in the Zoterama login dialog box.</li>
    <li>
      Lastly, scroll to the top of your list of Zotero API key on the same page. You'll find on top of the list a little text reading : 'Your userID for use in API calls is xxxxx'. That's your user ID ! You'll paste it in the Zoterama login dialog box.
    </li>
    <li>
      Now that you have your user ID and API key, you can paste them in the Zoterama login dialog box (middle column). If you want to save time and don't repeat the process, be sure to check "remember my credentials next time".
    </li>
  </ol>
